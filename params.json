We aim to provide for the efficient exchange of pathway data; aggregation and integration of pathways from major available sources into a shared public information store; distribution in a value-added, standardized form; availability to the end-user via advanced internet web service technology; and dissemination of the technology of biological knowledge representation and pathway analysis by collaboration and training.\r\n\r\nThis effort builds on the recent emergence of a diverse and active community of pathway databases, the development in this community of a common language for biological pathway data exchange ([BioPAX](http://www.biopax.org)) and work in the Sander and Bader groups since late 2002 in building infrastructure for managing, integrating, and analyzing pathway information.\r\n\r\nAuto-generated documentation (by Maven):  \r\n* [cPath2 6.1.0-SNAPSHOT](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/cpath2/6.1.0-SNAPSHOT/)\r\n\r\n## Funding ##\r\nPathway Commons: Research Resource for Biological Pathways, PIs: Chris Sander, Gary Bader, 1U41HG006623 (formerly 1 P41 P41HG04118)","google":"UA-43341809-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
