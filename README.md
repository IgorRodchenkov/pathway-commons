[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PathwayCommons/cpath2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PathwayCommons/cpath2)

A pathway data integration and query platform for [Pathway Commons](http://www.pathwaycommons.org) (PC). 

The long-term vision is to achieve a complete computable map of the cell across all species and conditions. We aim to provide for the efficient exchange of pathway data; aggregation and integration of pathways from major available sources into a shared public information store; distribution in a value-added, standardized form; availability to the end-user via advanced internet web service technology; and dissemination of the technology of biological knowledge representation and pathway analysis by collaboration and training.

This effort builds on the recent emergence of a diverse and active community of pathway databases, the development in this community of a common language for biological pathway data exchange ([BioPAX](http://www.biopax.org)) and work in the Sander and Bader groups since late 2002 in building infrastructure for managing, integrating, and analyzing pathway information.
